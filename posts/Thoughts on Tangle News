In middle school, I learned argumentative writing techniques. The core: dialectical commentary, echoing Hegel's thesis-antithesis-synthesis structure.  
  
Our world fractures. Media follows suit. Mainstream outlets, once balanced, now polarize. Neutral reporting vanishes. Readers struggle for unbiased news.  
  
Media rarely lies outright. They selectively tell truths. In China, it's "Spring and Autumn writing." You see what they want you to see.  
  
Tangle News[^1] breaks the mold. They're doing crucial work. Presenting left, right, and center views, they paint a complete picture. Objectivity challenges journalists, but Isaac Saul perseveres.  
  
Beyond politics, I hope to see more news outlets like Tangle News in other fields.
